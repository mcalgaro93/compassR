Description: This package provides a specialized pipeline for the analysis and
    interpretation of cell-to-cell metabolic heterogeneity based on the single-
    cell metabolic reaction consistency matrix produced by the COMPASS algorithm
    (\url{https://github.com/YosefLab/Compass}). It also includes a suite of
    expressive utility functions for conducting statistical analyses building
    thereupon.
